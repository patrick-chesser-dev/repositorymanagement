# Repository Management Sample Project
This is a project demonstrating a simple serverless application that provides convenience functionality for management of public git repositories. The scope of this project is to simply provide an API that will allow a user to request the count of the number of open pull requests against a give public github repository. I have designed the application to make it flexible enough to allow for management of other repositories in the future, as well as made it easy to provide additional functionality.
